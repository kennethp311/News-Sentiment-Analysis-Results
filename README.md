Here are the outputted graphs of what my program can do. <br /> 
the html files are interactable graphs made with plotly, while the png files are just static images. <br />
Simply Download the raw file of the html files to view the graph. The interactable graphs is where my program shines, unlike the images. <br />
The repository that houses my source code is currently private <br />
