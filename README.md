Here are the outputted graphs of what my program can do. <br /> 
the html files are interactable graphs made with plotly, while the png files are just static images. <br />
Simply Download the raw file of the html files to view the graph. The interactable graphs is where my program shines, unlike the images. <br />
The repository that houses my source code is currently private <br />

**How to Read the Plots:** <br />
(1) Score = # of goods news - # of bad news <br />
(2) Light Green = Good Sentiment, Dark Green = maximum Good Score (outlier) <br />
(3) Light red = Bad Sentiment, Dark Red = maximum Bad Score (outlier) <br />
(4) Blue = score is 0 i.e. neutral. <br />
(5) Smaller dots have smaller scores and vice versa. <br />
(6) Lower Opacity indicates that date is a weekend i.e. no trading day.
